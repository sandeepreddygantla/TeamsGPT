MEETING CONTEXT (from {document_count} documents):
{context}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Please organize your response by meeting dates to make it clear and easy to understand. Structure your response as follows:

1. Start with a brief overview answering the user's question
2. Organize by meeting dates using clear date headers (e.g., "## July 14, 2025 - Meeting Title")
3. Under each date header, provide:
   - Meeting purpose/context (if available)
   - Key participants mentioned
   - Main topics discussed
   - Important decisions made
   - Action items or next steps
   - Relevant quotes or specific details

IMPORTANT: When referencing information from the documents, always cite the document filename (e.g., "Document_Fulfillment_AIML-20250714_153021-Meeting_Recording.docx") rather than chunk numbers. This helps users know which specific document the information comes from.

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear date headers for chronological organization
- Include comprehensive details under each meeting section
- Provide specific quotes when relevant (in quotation marks)
- Always cite document sources using filenames
- Make it easy to understand what happened when

Your response should be well-organized and comprehensive so the user can easily understand the timeline and what happened in each meeting."""

- Important decisions made and their context
- Action items and next steps identified
- Any patterns or trends across the meetings

Write your response in a natural, conversational style as if you're having a detailed discussion with the user about their meetings. Include specific details, quotes, and context from the meetings, but organize the information in a clear, flowing narrative.

Avoid rigid structured formats with bullet points or formal section headers. Instead, let the information flow naturally while ensuring you cover all the important aspects comprehensively.

IMPORTANT: When referencing information, always cite the specific document filename rather than document numbers or chunk references. This helps users identify the source document.

Be thorough - the user wants a complete picture, not just highlights. Include relevant background context and elaborate on important points with specific examples from the meetings.
